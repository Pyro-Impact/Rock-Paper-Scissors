# Rock-Paper-Scissors

https://realpython.com/python-rock-paper-scissors/

I did not know how to randomize things in Python, so I was able to learn "import random" from this.
From the first 4-ish code blocks of the program, I learned a bare bones basic outline for an unrefined rock 
paper scissors game. I didn't use the rest of the article.

I wanted to refine the program so I found an answer here: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/147794

Dictionaries were not familiar to me, and reading the answer and modifying it for myself has led me to understand 
them well.

Main Modifications:
1. Added an option for the user to loop the program or quit the program.
2. Added different print statements.
3. Added new dictionary for tie verbs.
4. Changed variable names.
5. Added title case conversions and a variable for it.
